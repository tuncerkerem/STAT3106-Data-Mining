# STAT3106 Applied Data Mining

Applied Data Mining was a class covering logistic regression, naive bayes classifiers, principal component analysis, tree methods, regularized regressions, clustering, hierarchical clustering, feature engineering, feature selection, independent component analysis, and text mining among other topics. In this repository, you can find my write-ups for three different class projects:

1. The Relationship of 311 Complaints to the NYPD with Demographics and Poverty Status
- Logistic regression
2. An algorithm for receiving well-fitting yet diverse job recommendations
- TF-IDF, Jaccard similarity, cosine similarity, latent semantic analysis, clustering
3. Prediction of Trump/Clinton support using county demographics
- K-nearest neighbors classification
